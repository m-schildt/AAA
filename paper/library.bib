	abstract = {This paper analyzes difference-in-differences setups with a continuous treatment. We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to treatment effect heterogeneity. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular two-way fixed-effect specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation strategies that do not suffer from these drawbacks. Our results also cover cases where (i) there is no available untreated comparison group and (ii) there are multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, which are both common in empirical work.},

	abstract = {While much attention has been given to the problem of estimating the effect of discrete interventions from observational data, relatively little work has been done in the setting of continuous-valued interventions, such as treatments associated with a dosage parameter. In this paper, we tackle this problem by building on a modification of the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework. Our model, SCIGAN, is flexible and capable of simultaneously estimating counterfactual outcomes for several different continuous interventions. The key idea is to use a significantly modified GAN model to learn to generate counterfactual outcomes, which can then be used to learn an inference model, using standard supervised methods, capable of estimating these counterfactuals for a new sample. To address the challenges presented by shifting to continuous interventions, we propose a novel architecture for our discriminator - we build a hierarchical discriminator that leverages the structure of the continuous intervention setting. Moreover, we provide theoretical results to support our use of the GAN framework and of the hierarchical discriminator. In the experiments section, we introduce a new semi-synthetic data simulation for use in the continuous intervention setting and demonstrate improvements over the existing benchmark models.},

The nuisance estimators for the conditional expectation function and the conditional density can be nonparametric or ML methods. Utilizing a kernel-based doubly robust moment function and cross-fitting, we give high-level conditions under which the nuisance estimators do not affect the first-order large sample distribution of the DML estimators. We further provide sufficient low-level conditions for kernel, series, and deep neural networks. We propose a data-driven bandwidth to consistently estimate the optimal bandwidth that minimizes the asymptotic mean squared error. We justify the use of kernel to localize the continuous treatment at a given value by the Gateaux derivative.

Second, this chapter reviews recently proposed alternative approaches that are able to circumvent these issues without being substantially more complicated to implement.

Subsequently, it examines the multiplicity of policies deployed by the EU institutions to contain the socio-economic damages of the pandemic – including, most crucially, the EU recovery fund 'Next Generation EU' – and underlines their transformative effect on the EU architecture of economic governance. As the article argues, the responses to COVID-19 have produced a significant rebalancing of EMU, bridging the asymmetry between EU monetary and economic policy. Finally, the article considers whether the COVID-19-related responses are likely to be only temporary, or rather a new normal for EMU, and sheds light on further constitutional adaptations which are needed to sustain this unprecedented transfer of fiscal power to the EU level.},

The 17th Florence Air Forum, co-organised by the Florence School of Regulation’s Transport Area together with the Commission’s DG Competition, examined the hard impact of COVID-19 on the air sector while exploring possible ways forward to ensure its recovery. More specifically, it sought to analyse whether special needs exist in the short- and mid-term period, until the Aviation Guidelines are reviewed.
Drawing on the policy debates, this brief explores investment aid and support to green investments for airports and airlines with a view to meeting the European Green Deal objectives. Furthermore, the brief looks at operating aid to regional airports, which have been particularly heavily hit by the crisis, and more specifically discusses how long these regional airports might need public support. Another aspect examined here concerns air connectivity, which constitutes an essential component of the European Single Market, as it can foster cross-border trade, promote economic growth and European integration. The pandemic’s impact on the sector has raised concerns about a substantial loss of air connectivity. In view of this, the brief reflects on the need to adopt a temporary set of rules in the short-term to restore connectivity after the COVID-19 outbreak and to adjust existing rules on start-up aid in the mid- and long-term. Last but not least, this policy brief delves into the timely topic of remedies in mergers. A new round of consolidation in the industry can be expected as a result of the financial difficulties of many airlines. In order to protect competition, effective remedies will have to be identified.},

Based on a crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis of all 14 cases of alleged state aid to national airlines between 2004 and 2019, the article shows that both the approval and non-approval of aid are predominantly dependent upon the Commission’s technocratic assessment: a low degree of market distortion turns out to be a sufficient condition for the approval of aid, whereas a high degree of market distortion is a necessary condition for the non-approval of aid. However, in some cases, political factors are decisive in determining enforcement outcomes.},

This study analyzes 27 cases of state aid to EU airlines between 1 March 2020 and 30 September 2021 with a total amount of €31 billion. The information was obtained from the area of competition of the European Commission (EC), which is the entity responsible for final approval. Results indicate that the largest EU economies (Germany and France), as well as some Northern European countries, are supporting national airlines more extensively. Airlines with a weaker financial performance before the pandemic were more likely to receive state aid. Government involvement in the airline industry during the recent health crisis will have an important influence on the level playing field (LPF) for airlines. It is still unclear how this will evolve in the future, but it seems that some airlines now resemble the public flag companies of the past.},

As much health claim data become available, many studies have been conducted on the data. The real-world data is noisy, sparse, and has many confounding factors. In addition, many studies have shown that drugs effects are heterogeneous among the population. Lots of advanced machine learning models about estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) have emerged in recent years, and have been applied to in econometrics and machine learning communities. These studies acknowledge medicine and drug development as the main application area, but there has been limited translational research from the HTE methodology to drug development. We aim to introduce the HTE methodology to the healthcare area and provide feasibility consideration when translating the methodology with benchmark experiments on healthcare administrative claim data. Also, we want to use benchmark experiments to show how to interpret and evaluate the model when it is applied to healthcare research. By introducing the recent HTE techniques to a broad readership in biomedical informatics communities, we expect to promote the wide adoption of causal inference using machine learning. We also expect to provide the feasibility of HTE for personalized drug effectiveness.},

Available parametric methods are limited in their model space, and previous attempts in leveraging neural network to enhance model expressiveness relied on partitioning continuous treatment into blocks and using separate heads for each block; this however produces in practice discontinuous ADRFs. Therefore, the question of how to adapt the structure and training of neural network to estimate ADRFs remains open. This paper makes two important contributions. First, we propose a novel varying coefficient neural network (VCNet) that improves model expressiveness while preserving continuity of the estimated ADRF. Second, to improve finite sample performance, we generalize targeted regularization to obtain a doubly robust estimator of the whole ADRF curve.},

These estimators have a long history of development when the exposure of interest is binary and where the weights are typically functions of an estimated propensity score. Recent developments in optimization-based estimators for constructing weights in binary exposure settings, such as those based on entropy balancing, have shown more promise in estimating treatment effects than those methods that focus on the direct estimation of the propensity score using likelihood-based methods. This paper explores recent developments of entropy balancing methods to continuous exposure settings and the estimation of population dose-response curves using nonparametric estimation combined with entropy balancing weights, focusing on factors that would be important to applied researchers in medical or health services research. The methods developed here are applied to data from a study assessing the effect of non-randomized components of an evidence-based substance use treatment program on emotional and substance use clinical outcomes.},

Using administrative data on the universe of ﬁrms’ subsidies in Flanders, we estimate the causal impact of these subsidies on ﬁrm-level outcomes. Firms that received subsidies saw a 7\% increase in productivity, compared to ﬁrms that applied for, but did not obtain subsidies. Furthermore, the propensity to exit the market was 43\% lower for treated ﬁrms. Aggregate productivity growth, a share-weighted sum of ﬁrms’ productivity growth rates, amounted to 6\% in 2020. While within-ﬁrm productivity growth was similar for both subsidized and non-subsidized ﬁrms, there is a reallocation of market shares from subsidized ﬁrms to non-subsidized ﬁrms. These results suggest that Covid rescue policies helped ﬁrms to sustain and preserve productivity, while not obstructing allocative efﬁciency gains to non-subsidized ﬁrms.},

Although the number of ﬁrms ﬁling for bankruptcy in 2020 was much below its 2019 level (- 36\%) the same factors that predicted ﬁrm failures (primarily debt, cash holdings, productivity) in the past are at work during the COVID crisis. Morover, in 2020 as in 2019, zombie ﬁrms are more likely to fail than other ﬁrms. Hence, the selection process, although much reduced, has not been distorted in 2020. At this stage, partial hibernation rather than zombiﬁcation characterises the selection into ﬁrm survival or failure. We also ﬁnd that the sectoral heterogeneity of the turnover COVID shock (proxied by the change in credit card transactions) has been largely (but not fully) absorbed by public policy support because it predicts little of the probability of bankruptcy at the ﬁrm level. Finally, we sketch some potential scenarios for 2021-2022 for diﬀerent sectors. Even for sectors most aﬀected, our empirical estimates suggest that the rise in ﬁrm failures should mostly come from a catch-up eﬀect of ﬁrms that should have failed in 2020.},

The results, drawing on the experience of a small open European country, suggest the distributed COVID-19 subsidies save non-negligible number of jobs and sustain economic activity during the first wave of the pandemic. General distribution rules designed on the fly may bring close to optimal results in terms of the support allocation, as relatively more productive, privately owned, foreign-demand oriented firms are prioritized and firms with a high environmental footprint or zombie firms record a relatively lower chance of obtaining government funding. By assuming constant cost elasticities to sales, we show that the pandemic deteriorates strongly firm profits and increases significantly the share of illiquid and insolvent firms. Government wage subsidies somewhat mitigate firm losses and have statistically significant effect, but relatively mild compared to the size of the economic shock. Our estimates also confirm that larger firms, receiving smaller relative size of the support, have more space to cover their additional liquidity needs by increasing trade liabilities or liabilities to affiliated entities, while SMEs face higher risk of insolvencies.},

Although there has been a series of ongoing government policies to mitigate the economic effect of the pandemic, we do not know to what extent these policies have been effective. Using two-period panel data (before and during the pandemic) on 419 Italian firms, this study examines the impact of government policies on firms using first difference estimation. The results show that firms that received a government grant in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic saw on average an 11\% increase in sales revenue by the end of June 2020 compared to those yet to receive grants.

Dies ist nützlich, um effektive Hilfsmaßnahmen so zu gestalten, dass sie die Beschäftigung sichern, Insolvenzen genauso wie Insolvenzverschleppung vermeiden, die speziellen Gegebenheiten von Branchen berücksichtigen und die wirtschaftliche Erholung beschleunigen.

            Abstract
            For many firms, the coronavirus crisis has lead to persistent sales slumps that generated urgent liquidity demand — unless fixed costs were reduced. The authors use a newly developed classification procedure that makes the cost structure of companies and, thus, their sensitivity to sales shocks visible. This is useful for designing effective relief measures that preserve corporate structures by protecting employment and avoiding insolvencies of companies with healthy prospects for a recovery during the post-crisis period. Such an approach helps to accelerate economic recovery.},

In particular, it evaluates the extent to which firms may run into a liquidity crisis following the COVID-19 outbreak and the impact of stylised policy measures to reduce the risks and depth of such crisis. The analysis relies on three ingredients: a simple accounting model, a large dataset reporting firms’ balance sheets for 14 countries and granular data on the magnitude of the shock measuring the impact of confinement measures on economic activity (notably depending on the capacity of each sector to operate by teleworking). Results suggest that, without any policy intervention, up to 38\% of firms would face liquidity shortfalls after 10 months since the implementation of confinement measures. Comparing the impact of different policies (tax deferral, debt moratorium and support to wage payments), the analysis shows that government support to relieve wage bills is the most effective tool to reduce liquidity shortages, followed by debt moratorium policies. Finally, the paper zooms into labour market policies and compares the costefficiency of short-term work and wage subsidies schemes, highlighting how their relative efficiency depends on their design.},

In the first months of the crisis, SMEs as the backbone of Germany’s economy benefited from large and mainly indiscriminate aid measures. Avoiding business failures in a whatever-it-takes fashion contrasts, however, with the cleansing mechanism of economic crises: a mechanism which forces unviable firms out of the market, thereby reallocating resources efficiently. By focusing on firms’ pre-crisis financial standing, we estimate the extent to which the policy response induced an insolvency gap and analyze whether the gap is characterized by firms which were already struggling before the pandemic. With the policy measures being focused on smaller firms, we also examine whether this insolvency gap differs with respect to firm size. Our results show that the COVID-19 policy response in Germany has triggered a backlog of insolvencies that is particularly pronounced among financially weak, small firms, having potential long-term implications on entrepreneurship and economic recovery.},

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org//a/onb/oenbmp/y2021iq4-20-q1-21b4.html},
	abstract = {We employ a novel modeling approach to capture the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sectoral insolvency rates in Austria. Turnover shocks derived from a macroeconomic scenario generate stress to firms’ profits and cash flows. Over time, both the equity and the liquidity (cash and bank) positions deteriorate, which causes insolvencies if firms fall under certain thresholds. Our model builds on data for nonfinancial incorporated Austrian enterprises available from the BACH and SABINA databases. Since only two firm-level variables (equity ratio, cash and bank) are available at sufficient coverage, we generate a hypothetical firmlevel dataset for 17 NACE 1 sectors by using a Monte Carlo simulation. The granularity of our model allows us to assess the impact of mitigating measures implemented in light of the COVID-19 shock. Such measures serve to cushion the loss of companies’ revenue and households’ income triggered by the COVID-19 containment measures. Put differently, they are meant to minimize the damage resulting from the deliberate temporary reduction in economic activity. In our analysis, we only investigate measures aimed at firms. These measures include equity injections via grants and subsidies (e.g. short-time work), longterm payment deferrals (e.g. credit guarantees) and short-term payment deferrals (e.g. social security contributions). We used all available data sources to calibrate the mitigating measures, with August 31, 2020, as cutoff date. The model indicates a marked increase of COVID-19-induced insolvency rates, but mitigating measures reduce such insolvencies substantially. Without mitigating measures, the insolvency rate would rise to 5.8\% by the end of 2020, more than quintupling its pre-crisis average (2017–2019: 1.0\%). By end-2022, 9.9\% of all Austrian firms would fail, which corresponds to an annual insolvency rate of 3.3\%. With mitigating measures in place, the insolvency rate is significantly lower, reaching 2.1\% by end-2020, and 6.9\% by end-2022. Projected insolvency rates should be interpreted with caution. The merit of this novel approach, however, lies less in the calculated sectoral insolvency rates themselves, but in the model’s capacity to compare and rank the efficiency and efficacy of various mitigating measures. As to the current measures, we, for instance, find that credit guarantees appear most effective, followed by fixed cost support and short-time work. In the short term, delayed filing for insolvency is most efficient, but is set to mostly reverse itself in 2021, once public institutions recommence their usual practice. At the OeNB, the model has also been used to assess implementation delays and the extension of mitigating measures. We intend to continuously extend the model, both in terms of its core functionality and the calibration of mitigating measures to address questions from (1) a macroeconomic perspective, in particular the loss of productive capacities (potential output), (2) a fiscal policy perspective, to estimate the costs of mitigating measures, and (3) a macro- and microprudential banking supervisory perspective, to provide a basis for estimating credit default probabilities for the banking system.},

Our results show that state aid was more readily transferred to micro-entities that had been insignificant employers and expanding their performance during the pandemic through increasing employment and revenues. Since the governmental programmes in Poland were assumed to stabilise enterprises’ revenues, our study allowed assessing their effectiveness in this regard. The problem of longer-term revenue decreases and increases was identified among supported micro-entities. Revenue decreases primarily resulted from the overall deterioration of their economic position. These beneficiaries, most of all, stood out with longer-term declines in liquidity and profitability, redundancies of employment, and stressed access to financial market funding. Thus, the aid was insufficient concerning their actual needs, though it came from generous measures. In turn, the supported micro-entities with revenue growth during the pandemic were found to be resilient to stress conditions, with access to selected market and non-market liquidity, and increasing their liquidity and profitability in the longer term. Despite the fact that they did not need to be supported, they often benefited from state aid provided within an unconditionally available measure. Based on the results obtained, recommendations for policymakers have been formulated regarding allocation aspects of support for micro-entities during a pandemic.},

First, we provide evidence that firms defined as non-viable prior to the pandemic were more likely to apply for and be granted tax deferrals than their healthier counterparts. This finding alone would imply that such firms might have exploited the arrangement to stay alive. Further, we estimate the effect of being granted tax deferrals on the probability of going bankrupt in 2020 or 2021. In 2020, we find that the firms granted tax deferrals were significantly less likely to go bankrupt than what would have been the case in the absence of support. However, we do not find statistically significant results when the same relationship is estimated in 2021. In sum, this implies that the arrangement may have kept non-viable firms artificially alive, albeit for a limited period of time.},

	abstract = {The economic recession triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic has generated a negative impact on ﬁrms’ liquidity needs, induced both by the rigidity of costs and ﬁnancial commitments and by the drop in sales linked to the restrictions on economic activities imposed during the periods of pandemic propagation. This paper analyzes these eﬀects on the liquidity needs of Italian ﬁrms, before and after the government support interventions, focusing on non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms with revenues up to EUR 50 million and with fewer than 250 employees. By constructing a new dataset that integrates information from multiple sources, we show that government measures have strongly contributed to mitigate the eﬀects of the crisis, almost halving the percentage of companies in liquidity crisis at the end of 2020 (from 38.1\% to 18.2\%) and limiting the liquidity requirements of companies from 83.7 to 26.5 billion. The access to public guarantee schemes on loans would have further reduced the deﬁcit to EUR 18.5 billion. Debt standstills and ﬁxed cost refunds have been very eﬀective in supporting ﬁrms, that have actually recorded a liquidity deﬁcit due to pandemic crisis.},

	abstract = {The economic shutdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic witnessed a surge in drawdowns on pre-existing credit lines. This paper examines how this liquidity was used by ﬁrms. Drawdowns were associated with an immediate accumulation of liquid assets followed by a depletion of this liquidity as the U.S. economy stabilized after the spring of 2020. Drawdowns were generally not associated with greater levels of physical investment or employment either immediately after the drawdowns or several months later. Rather, the depletion of liquidity is simultaneous with an increase in the equity to assets ratio, consistent with repayments of the drawdowns. These facts are consistent with the idea that ﬁrms drew down their credit lines due to a precautionary motive to mitigate future liquidity risk until the economy started to stabilize. However, we ﬁnd evidence that ﬁrms in industries that were less aﬀected by the shutdown, such as professional services that can be performed remotely, were relatively more likely to use drawdowns to maintain investment rather than accumulate liquidity. On the intensive margin, this is especially true for ﬁrms in such industries that drew a relatively small amount of funds.},

	abstract = {In the context of a binary treatment, matching is a well-established approach in causal inference. However, in the context of a continuous treatment or exposure, matching is still underdeveloped. We propose an innovative matching approach to estimate an average causal exposure-response function under the setting of continuous exposures that relies on the generalized propensity score (GPS). Our approach maintains the following attractive features of matching: a) clear separation between the design and the analysis; b) robustness to model misspecification or to the presence of extreme values of the estimated GPS; c) straightforward assessment of covariate balance. We first introduce an assumption of identifiability, called local weak unconfoundedness. Under this assumption and mild smoothness conditions, we provide theoretical guarantees that our proposed matching estimator attains point-wise consistency and asymptotic normality. In simulations, our proposed matching approach outperforms existing methods under settings of model misspecification or the presence of extreme values of the estimated GPS. We apply our proposed method to estimate the average causal exposure-response function between long-term PM\$\_\{2.5\}\$ exposure and all-cause mortality among 68.5 million Medicare enrollees, 2000-2016. We found strong evidence of a harmful effect of long-term PM\$\_\{2.5\}\$ exposure on mortality. Code for the proposed matching approach is provided in the CausalGPS R package, which is available on CRAN and provides a computationally efficient implementation.},

GPS adjustment may be implemented by including it as a covariate in an outcome regression. Here, the unbiased estimation of the dose-response function assumes correct specification of both the GPS and the outcome-treatment relationship. This paper introduces a machine learning method, the 'Super Learner', to address model selection in this context. In the two-stage estimation approach proposed, the Super Learner selects a GPS and then a dose-response function conditional on the GPS, as the convex combination of candidate prediction algorithms. We compare this approach with parametric implementations of the GPS and to regression methods. We contrast the methods in the Risk Adjustment in Neurocritical care cohort study, in which we estimate the marginal effects of increasing transfer time from emergency departments to specialised neuroscience centres, for patients with acute traumatic brain injury. With parametric models for the outcome, we find that dose-response curves differ according to choice of specification. With the Super Learner approach to both regression and the GPS, we find that transfer time does not have a statistically significant marginal effect on the outcomes. © 2015 The Authors.

Using an approach based on the generalised propensity score (GPS) ? a generalisation of the classical, binary treatment propensity score ? it is possible to construct a balancing score that provides an estimation procedure for the true (unconfounded) direct effect of dose on response. Previously, the GPS has been applied only in a single interval setting; in this article, we extend the GPS methodology to the longitudinal setting to estimate the direct effect of a continuous dose on a longitudinal response. The methodology is applied to two simulated examples, and a real longitudinal dose?response investigation, the Monitored Occlusion Treatment of Amblyopia Study (MOTAS). In the treatment of childhood amblyopia, a common ophthalmological condition, occlusion therapy (patching) was for many decades the standard medical treatment, despite the fact that its efficacy was not quantified. MOTAS was revolutionary, as it was the first study to obtain precise measurements of the amount of occlusion each study participant received over the course of the study.},

Our results suggest public subsidies follow an S-shaped relationship and inverted-U correlation with the firm's total R\&D and private R\&D investment, respectively. There is a saturation point beyond which a further increase in public subsidies does not yield an increase of firm's total R\&D investment. A minimum threshold value of public subsidies is required to induce the firm's private R\&D spending. There are also critical values beyond which a further increase in public subsidies would partially or completely crowd out a firm's private R\&D investment. Our conclusion implies the existence of an optimal interval of subsidy, and thus could help to improve the efficiency of public subsidies.},

More in detail, grants appear to consistently affect traditional investment and similarly, R\&D incentives have a positive impact on research spending. The paper also finds that grants trigger the use of long medium term credit suggesting that public policy may possibly help firms facing financial constraints and foster their growth. Finally, the analysis reveals some heterogeneity across the seven countries considered.},

	abstract = {Propensity score methods are a part of the standard toolkit for applied researchers who wish to ascertain causal effects from observational data. While they were originally developed for binary treatments, several researchers have proposed generalizations of the propensity score methodology for non-binary treatment regimes. Such extensions have widened the applicability of propensity score methods and are indeed becoming increasingly popular themselves. In this article, we closely examine two methods that generalize propensity scores in this direction, namely, the propensity function (PF), and the generalized propensity score (GPS), along with two extensions of the GPS that aim to improve its robustness. We compare the assumptions, theoretical properties, and empirical performance of these methods. On a theoretical level, the GPS and its extensions are advantageous in that they are designed to estimate the full dose response function rather than the average treatment effect that is estimated with the PF. We compare GPS with a new PF method, both of which estimate the dose response function. We illustrate our findings and proposals through simulation studies, including one based on an empirical study about the effect of smoking on healthcare costs. While our proposed PF-based estimator preforms well, we generally advise caution in that all available methods can be biased by model misspecification and extrapolation.},
