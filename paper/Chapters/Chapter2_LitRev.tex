\section{Pandemic effects}

The negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy have become evident in many areas. Many businesses were severely affected by drops in demand and through lockdowns ordered by authorities. When business operations are halting while costs like rent or personal costs continue occurring the pandemic shock eventually leads to negative cash flows for many firms \parencite{fernandez-cerezo_firm-level_2021}.
Depending on the affectedness of the business, the liquidity reserves will inevitably deteriorate and eventually liquidity shortfalls are inescapable with negative cash flows \parencite{puhr_have_2021}.
Although the demand of liquidity is individual for every company, a simulation study from Italy quantified the total liquidity deficit of all Italian SMEs caused by the Covid-19 shock to 83.7 billion Euros at the end of 2020 \parencite{bellucci_consequences_2022}. 
In comparison for the Belgian corporate sector, in a scenario without policy interventions, the drop in liquidity by September 2020 is quantified with 28.2 billion Euros \parencite{tielens_belgian_2020}. 

Empirical results from Tielens et al. (2020) suggest that in Belgium even businesses that used to be profitable require a large amount of additional financing to offset their liquidity shortfall.

Without a return of profits, firms are in need of liquidity injection to, either through additional equity or via debt. For smaller unlisted firms it is usually not possible to easily raising equity, therefore they usually left with the debt option and rely on credits from banks \parencite{pagano_covid-19_2022}. Pagano and Zechner \parencite*{pagano_covid-19_2022} analyzed the effects of covid 19 on companies’ financial performance in the EU. Their evidence suggests differences in the effects between large firms and small and medium sized enterprises. By comparing the years 2019 and 2020 the authors found that smaller companies tend to increase their ratio of total debt to total assets (debt-ratio) whereas, large companies also increase their leverage, but significantly less. Regarding liquidity, their findings suggest that small and medium sized enterprises increased their cash-to-total-assets-ratio more than large companies. Small companies did so even more than medium sized ones. However, the authors could only speculate over the reason behind of this observation. Plausible reasons were precautionary cash hording and greater risk aversion. Additionally, the authors raise the theory that smaller companies were able to raise cash more easily due to the claim, that loan guarantee programs favored small firms. However, the analyzed sample of small and medium sized enterprises was not representative of any specific industry, nor of aid recipients.

However, credits from banks, if obtainable, increases the firms leverage and could make the firm vulnerable to new liquidity shortfalls. And additional leverage only prevents from insolvency if there is a prospect that future cash flows will enable a firm to service the additional debt. Regarding the capital structure, increased leverage means a weaker equity ratio. An early Survey study from September 2020 analyzed the implications of the pandemic crisis on the equity of Germany companies and reported that for most companies the equity ratio did not change, however a strong sectoral heterogeneity with travel and gastronomy having a reduction in the equity ratio between 1.8 \% and 1.5 \% \parencite{peichl_eigenkapitalentwicklung_2021}. In Spain a survey looked at the indebtedness as well as the cash ratio of enterprises and reported findings that support the heterogeneity of the covid 19 shock across firms and, that the impact was larger for small, young and less productive firms located in urban areas \parencite{fernandez-cerezo_firm-level_2021}. Further support for the heterogeneity of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on firms’ sales and costs came from Belgium \parencite{dhyne_belgian_2021}.

A simulation on 14 relatively well-covered European countries estimated that an increase in the financial debt of companies has on average a negative impact on the growth of investment after the crisis, indicating negative long-term effects increased leverage \parencite{demmou_insolvency_2021}.

\section{Government support effects}

The magnitude of policy responses has already provoked many researchers to look into the effects and effectiveness of various support measures. The difficult data situation has led scientists to explore different routes. Early attempts overcame the lack of data by conduction simulations studies. \parencite{ebeke_corporate_2021} estimate that in Europe the share of illiquid firms would have tripled from pre-crisis levels in the absence of policy measures.

A modelling approach by \parencite{puhr_have_2021} indicates that supporting measures in Austrian helped to reduce insolvencies by around one third. 

For European companies a simulation by \parencite{demmou_liquidity_2021} suggests that the combination of different measures helped to reduce the share of illiquid companies significantly with relieves for wage bills being the most effective tool.

A model by \parencite{chang_studying_2022} suggests that deferring taxes is the single best option of income cuts of 25 \%, but a combination of loan and equity based aid is the best option when revenue drops are larger than 50 \%.

The modelling by \parencite{parlapiano_effects_2020} support the effectiveness of Italian support measures in reducing illiquidity, but also report that loan based aid increased the indebtedness measured by a debt-to-asset like ratio of 1.2 \%.

With a conceptual approach \parencite{bischof_bedeutung_2021} assessed the regulatory design of grants in Germany and argue for heterogenous effects for different industries based on their cost structure. Their justification is based transmission factors which are referring to the relationship between the average decrease in revenue and average decrease in profit of an industry. The factor can be crucial for the effect of aid schemes that are compensating costs proportionately because it has implications on the relative compensation of profits \parencite{bischof_bedeutung_2021}. According to the numbers provided in the paper, Food and beverage service activities are industries with a higher transmission than Travel agency and tour operator activities, as well as creative, arts and entertainment activities. Even lower transmission is reported for the industry of sports activities and amusement and recreation activities.

Other assessments were based on survey data from various countries in many ways. Indications for positive effects aid for micro microenterprises as well as self-employed are reported by \parencite{kochaniak_effectiveness_2023,bertschek_german_2022}

A firm-level assessment was conducted by \parencite{bellucci_consequences_2022} suggesting that remedy measures in Italy have almost halving the percentage of illiquid SMEs at the end of 2020. 

In Slovakia government wage subsidies reduced the probability of illiquidity for recipients \parencite{lalinsky_distribution_2021}.

Similar findings were also reported for Euro area firms by \parencite{de_santis_impact_2021} and worldwide by \parencite{igan_shot_2023}.

\parencite{harasztosi_firm-level_2022} find evidence that companies that got support expanded their balance sheet more than unsupported firms. In case of an expansion through debt, part of the change could be explained by the loan-based aid, but not in the case of equity, although the authors report that policy support raised the probability of an increase in the equity base \parencite{harasztosi_firm-level_2022}.

\parencite{stien_covid-19_2022} analyzed the effect of tax deferrals in Norway and reports evidence for a significant decrease in the risk for bankruptcy.

The measures taken by the Belgian authorities to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on companies earnings have been effective in averting serious solvency issues \parencite{piette_how_2022}.

\parencite{costa_state-aids_2021} used a difference-in-differences method to assess different types of support in Portugal. The reported average treatment effects for debt based that aid measures suggests considerable contribution to firms’ liquidity.

Authors also investigated the effects of state aid on the productivity and firm performance. Firms in Italy with government grants in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic saw an 11 \% increase in sales revenue by the end of June 2020 compared to those yet to receive the grant \parencite{turkson_government_2021}. \parencite{konings_impact_nodate} employed a difference-in-differences model with Flemish beneficiaries of government support suggesting that the aid helped sustain and preserve productivity.
