\noindent

By matching information on firm level from two sources this thesis provides insights on the effects of government support during the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate the effects of the pandemic shock the German government responded with unprecedented fiscal efforts to provide liquidity to the economy and prevent business from failing. 
To provide an impact assessment a quasi-experimental approach with a DiD regression is employed to estimate the causal effect of aid measures on the liquidity and solvency of companies.
The results suggest that in 2020 loan-based measures supported companies by improving their liquidity by 5.3 \%, while grant based aid was insufficient as a liquidity injection since beneficiaries had no improvement in liquidity and relatively higher debt.
Only in 2021 grants programs became effective in providing liquidity and preserving the equity of firms. In 2021 the liquidity increase of grant beneficiaries was 7.7 \%, twice as high as the effect of grants in 2021.

Moreover, insolvencies of aid beneficiaries were analyzed. Results suggest that they were already significantly weaker before the pandemic and that aid measures were less effective in providing them support compared to the overall population of beneficiaries. However, a sector view reveals that the industries that are most represented amongst beneficiaries (“Food” and “Accommodation”) show insolvency rates well below the average, suggesting that aid measures were successful in reduced the chance of insolvency in their presumed main target sectors.

Finally, to provide a deeper understanding of the aid measures and fully exploit the data granularity a combination of generalized propensity scores and a GAM is employed to advance the assessment from a binary to continuous treatment perspective.
This approach allows to visualize the effect of aid by showing the relationship between aid payments and change liquidity as well as solvency of beneficiaries. Overall, the visualizations are in line with results from the “average” view DiD results and don’t show any concerning abnormalities. In greater detail the visualization reveal heterogeneity amongst beneficiaries from different industries, which [do not] connect with the observed heterogeneity in insolvencies of different industries.


Insolvency

Finally, to provide a deeper understanding of the aid measures and fully exploit the data granularity a combination of generalized propensity scores and a GAM is employed to advance the assessment from a binary to continuous treatment perspective.
This approach allows to visualizes the effect of aid by showing the relationship between aid payments and change liquidity as well as solvency of beneficiaries. Overall, the visualization are in line with results from the “average” view DiD results and don’t show any concering abnormalities. In greater detail the visualization reveal heterogeneity amongst industries, like the risk of insolvencies.
